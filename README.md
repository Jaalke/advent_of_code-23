# Advent of Code 2023

This is the first year I'm doing advent of code, and I only started a few days
into December, so I decided to do a little twist on it - since I doubt I'll be
able to finish all of it before the 25th. The idea is to do every day in a different
programming language.

## Rules

I'm not sure how far I'll be able to take this, since honestly I'd be hard pressed
to **name** 25 programming languages, let alone write a program in each. Still,
I'll try to keep it going as long as I can just for a laugh really. The rules I'm
following aren't terribly strict. Superset languages are allowed, as long as the 
code written in the superset isn't valid in the original language - so if I finish
one task in C, I can do another in C++, so long as I make use of unique C++ features.

I try to pick the language before I have a look at the task, but I don't have any
pattern behind my choices.

## Progress so far (by day)

1. **C** - both parts done
2. **Java** - both parts done
3. **Python** - WIP
